## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subfield derived from the artificial intelligence field.
Is is concerned with creating mathematical models to help understand data.
These models have tunable parameters that can be adapted to observe data.
That is, we can say that the program is *learning* from the data.
After these models have been adjusted to previously collected data, they can be used to predict and understand aspects of newly observed data.

Machine learning can be categorized into two main types: *supervised* learning and *unsupervised* learning.

### Supervised learning

Supervised learning involves modeling the relationship between measured features of data and some label associated with the data.
In other words, the algorithm receives pairs of inputs and desired outputs and finds a way to produce the desired output given an input.
This category is subdivided into *classifications* tasks, where the labels are discrete quantities, and *regression* tasks, where the labels are continuous quantities.

### Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning involves modeling the features of a dataset without reference from any label, that is, the algorithm receives only the input data.
These models include tasks as *clustering*, where the objective is to identify distinct groups of data, and *dimensionality reduction*, where the algorithms search for more succinct representations of the data.
